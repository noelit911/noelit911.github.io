There will be 5 different series, one for each malware chain stage:

1. **Payload Unleashed**: Explore the intricate world of payload execution techniques utilized by malware to execute malicious code within the target environment, including process injection, shellcode execution, and direct system calls.
    
2. **Evasion Quest**: Journey through the realm of evasion and anti-analysis techniques employed by malware to evade detection and analysis by security tools and researchers, covering tactics such as polymorphism, obfuscation, and sandbox evasion.
    
3. **Persistence Conundrums**: Delve into the strategies and mechanisms used by malware to maintain persistence on infected systems, including registry modifications, startup services, and rootkit installation.
    
4. **Cover Connections**: Navigate the complex landscape of communication and data exfiltration techniques employed by malware to communicate with command and control (C2) servers, exfiltrate sensitive data, and evade network detection mechanisms.

The entries for each series will be the following:
